<H4>Rayturbo:</H4> android project template using raylib cross platform graphics/game library.
The result of many hours of digging through the internet for translations and no small combinations, but in the end it is, it works! Now you can import the template and build your apk application in c / c ++ using the integrated android studio environment, of course running everything on your machine requires additional sdk / ndk / java installation and configuration.

<H4>Pngblob:</H4> software to exist for encrypt any file. (EXPERIMENTAL!)
With this software you can encrypt any file and turn it into a png image at the same time. A picture key is used for encryption, the key can be any png picture. The png blob can generate a random key for you, but if you want, you can use any png image as a key.
